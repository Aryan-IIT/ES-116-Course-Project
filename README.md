## Description of files

- There 3 C++ codes and 3 text files. For refrence, let us refer to them as Set_1, Set_2 and Set_3.
  
- Set_1 : The file [Threshold helper](helper_threshold.ino) is essential to decide the threshold value of the sensor at recevier's end. The method to do so is provided in [Threshold Helper Text](helper_threshold.txt).

- Set_2 : The file [Receiver Code](receiver.ino) is implemented on the Arduino+Laptop based system at the signal receiving end. This system is connected to a solar panel in a cardboard casing. This is used to decode the laser pulse (8-bit binary) to ASCII based text. This beam is aligned along the solar panel. The explaination of the code applied is provided in [Receiver Code Explaination.](receiver.txt)

- Set_3 : The file [Transmitter Code](receiver.ino) is implemented on the Arduino+Laptop based system at the signal transmitting end. This system is connected to a laser diode. This system is used to encode an ASCII based string to binary, which is transmitted via a laser pulse. The explaination of the code applied is provided in [Transmitter Code Explaination.](transmitter.txt)
